  #### In ResNets, unlike in traditional neural networks, each layer feeds into the next layer, we use a network with residual blocks, each layer feeds into the next layer and directly into the layers about 2â€“3 hops away, to avoid over-fitting (a situation when validation loss stop decreasing at a point and then keeps increasing while training loss still decreases). This also helps in preventing vanishing gradient problem and allow us to train deep neural networks. Here is a simple residual block. We trained ResNet9 model with 6,589,734 parameters for this task.
  ##### The achieved accuracy on the test dataset was 99.2%

  ### The prediction workflow is like this:

#### 1. The user uploads an image of a leaf belonging to the diseased plant

#### 2. The uploaded image is first temporarily stored in a folder named "uploads"

#### 3. The prediction is carried out by creating a new instance of the ResNet model and loading the trained model (all its weights and biases) into it

#### 4. The image is then preprocessed (its converted into a tensor, and then normalized) and the disease is then predicted using the model

#### 5. These results are then displayed to the user, along with a link to the page containing the details of the disease
